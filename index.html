  <h3>Fastest car - Hennessey Venom GT</h3>
    <p>
      In 2014, a Hennessey Venom GT was recorded as exceeding 270.49 mph (435.31 km/h), but as the run was in one direction only, and only 16 cars out of a planned total of 29 have been sold, it does not qualify under the Guinness Book of Records or this list's criteria as the worlds fastest production car.
